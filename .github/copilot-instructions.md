# Copilot Instructions for github-copilot-prompts-instructions-testing

## Project Overview
This repository is for testing and documenting GitHub Copilot prompt instructions and custom chat modes in VS Code. The structure is minimal, focusing on prompt customization and agent guidance.

## Key Files & Structure
- `README.md`: Main documentation, includes links and notes on adding chat modes.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: This file, for agent guidance.

## Essential Knowledge for AI Agents
- **Purpose**: Experimentation with Copilot prompt instructions and chat mode customization.
- **Customization Reference**: The main workflow is to review and update prompt instructions, referencing [VS Code Copilot Customization Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes).
- **No Build/Test Workflows**: There are no build scripts, tests, or application code. Focus is on documentation and prompt structure.
- **No External Dependencies**: The repo does not use package managers or external libraries.
- **Conventions**:
  - Documentation is markdown-based.
  - All changes should be concise and focused on agent productivity and prompt clarity.
  - When updating instructions, preserve actionable, project-specific advice and avoid generic Copilot tips.

## Example Workflow
1. Review `README.md` for current documentation and links.
2. Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with new findings or conventions.
3. Reference VS Code documentation for chat mode customization as needed.

## Patterns & Integration Points
- The only integration is with VS Code Copilot chat modes and prompt instructions.
- No code, APIs, or service boundaries exist in this repo.

## How to Contribute
- Add new markdown documentation for any discovered prompt patterns or agent guidance.
- Keep instructions concise and relevant to this repo's focus on Copilot prompt testing.
